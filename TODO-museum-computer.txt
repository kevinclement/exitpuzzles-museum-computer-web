[ ] wire up all 5 buttons
  [ ] create cables and solder all
  [ ] wire to quiz and sockets

## Pass/Fail:
[ ] final score screen
  [ ] number correct
  [ ] number incorrect
[ ] if all questions are correct, show passcode
[ ] if any of them are wrong
  [ ] "press any button to restart quiz"
  [ ] restart, for sure repeat questions they got wrong, plus potentially some new ones

## Launch Screen
[ ] design screen
  [ ] "Insert Quiz Disk 2/2 to continue..."
  [ ] if disk 1 is remove and reinserted, noop from launch screen
  [ ] if disk 2 is removed and disk 1 is inserted, goes back to launch screen
[ ] when disk 2 is inserted and detected, start quiz screens
  [ ] need to figure out how to listen for this mounting/unmounting
    
## Firebase Connection:

[ ] should probably figure out what max characters are for it to fix on screen and limit that
