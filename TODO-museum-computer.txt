[ ] wire up all 5 buttons
  [ ] create cables and solder all
  [ ] wire to quiz and sockets

[ ] how to do a full reset?  e.g. get rid of missed questions
  [ ] maybe button press for 20s

[ ] do we want sounds?
  [ ] check built in monitor and see how bad that is
[ ] simple test rig for buttons with wood I have?

## Pass/Fail:
[ ] final score screen
  [ ] number correct
  [ ] number incorrect
[ ] if all questions are correct, show passcode
[ ] if any of them are wrong
  'you scored 87%, try again for a perfect score.'
  'congrats, you scored 100%.'
  score value is 5 digits
  when scoring 100%, 5 digit final score is passcode to lock
  
  [ ] "press any button to restart quiz"
  [x] restart, repeat questions they got wrong, plus potentially some new ones
 
## Launch Screen
[ ] design screen
  [ ] "Insert Quiz Disk 2/2 to continue..."
  [ ] if disk 1 is remove and reinserted, noop from launch screen
  [ ] if disk 2 is removed and disk 1 is inserted, goes back to launch screen
[ ] when disk 2 is inserted and detected, start quiz screens
  [ ] need to figure out how to listen for this mounting/unmounting

## Password Screen
[ ] "insert password to continue"
    
## Firebase Connection:
[ ] node app can get questions from firebase and update locally cached questions
[ ] should probably figure out what max characters are for it to fix on screen and limit that
[ ] some sort of support for remote update?  
  [ ] I can toggle a bit in firebase and it will do a git pull and restart of pm2
  [ ] tie that into the ux ui to show last pull and possible need to refresh with a button

--------------------------------------------
[x] convert to vue
  [x] cleanup helloworld and map to prototype
[x] write test buttons for correct/incorrect
[x] What behavior do we want for correct vs incorret answer?

[x] questions stored in json files
    [x] question
    [x] answers A-E
    [x] correct answer attribute
[x] properly supports newlines in questions
    [x] newlines should get mapped to <p>
[x] test button wiring raw
[x] wire up button to pi
[x] pi node app to detect button press
[x] websocket connection to webpage
[x] randomization to questions
[x] question status somewhere, e.g "Question 1/15"
